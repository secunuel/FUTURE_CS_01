# FUTURE_CS_01 â€“ Web Application Vulnerability Assessment

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is part of my Future Interns Cybersecurity Internship (Track Code: CS).  
For Task 1, I performed a **web application vulnerability assessment** on DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application), following **OWASP standards**.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)  
- Kali Linux (Burp Suite, SQLMap, OWASP ZAP, Hydra)  
- OWASP Top 10 Framework  

## ðŸš€ Steps Taken
1. Installed and configured DVWA in Kali Linux.  
2. Performed **SQL Injection** test on login forms.  
3. Detected **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerabilities.  
4. Conducted **Brute Force attack simulation** on weak logins.  
5. Documented findings and provided remediation recommendations.  

## ðŸ“· Evidence
Screenshots available in `/screenshots/`:  
- `dvwa_login.png`  
- `sql_injection.png`  
- `xss_attack.png`  

## ðŸ“„ Report
The full vulnerability assessment is documented in `report.pdf`.
